What is Chiropractic?
The word chiropractic comes from Greek χειρο- chiro- (itself from χείρ cheir "hand"), "hand" and πρακτικός praktikos, "to do or practice", thus chiropractic- "to practice with the hands".
Chiropractic is a form of alternative medicine concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system, especially the spine, under the belief that such a disorder affects general health via the nervous system. The main chiropractic treatment technique, referred to by Chirpractors as a chiropractic adjustments, involves manual therapy, especially manipulation of the spine, other joints, and soft tissues, but may also include exercises and health and lifestyle counseling.

Chiropractic adjustment
The Chiropractor uses his hands to adjust the vertebrae that have abnormal movement patterns or fail to function normally, with the goals of increasing range of motion, reducing nerve irritability and improving function.

History
Chiropractic was founded in 1895 by Daniel David (D.D.) Palmer in Davenport, Iowa. Palmer, a magnetic healer, hypothesized that manual manipulation of the spine could cure disease. The first chiropractic patient of D.D. Palmer was Harvey Lillard, a worker in the building where Palmer's office was located. He claimed that he had severely reduced hearing for 17 years, which started soon following a "pop" in his spine. A few days following his adjustment, Lillard claimed his hearing was almost completely restored.

Today, there are 18 accredited Doctor of Chiropractic programs in the U.S., 2 in Canada, 6 in Australasia, and 5 in Europe. All but one of the chiropractic colleges in the U.S. are privately funded, but in several other countries they are in government-sponsored universities and colleges.  There are over 49,000 chiropractors practicing in the United States, 6,500 in Canada, 1,500 in the U.k. but as of 2016, only 16 currently licensed to practice in Costa Rica, all of whom received their degrees in Universities in the United States.

Dr. Steven Harlow received his Doctor of Chiropractic degree in December 1980 from Life Chiropractic College (now called Life University) in Marietta, Georgia, in the United States.  He graduated at the top of his graduating class.  He then opened a practice in Newington, Connecticut where he practiced for over 20 years.  He came to Costa Rica in February 2004 to visit his father who had vacation home in Puntarenas and was so taken by the beauty and Pura Vida of Costa Rica (and Ana, the sister-in-law of his father's grounds-keeper) that he decided to retire to Costa Rica--he and Ana were married 6 months later.

After a few months rest, Steven began considering opening a practice in Puntarenas.  His wife Ana informed him that there already was a Chiropractor practicing in Puntarenas and encouraged him to go see him, which he did.

To Steven's surprise, Dr. Daniel Rukeyser, who had established his practice, Quiropractica Vital, a year earlier was extremely glad to meet him, for as it turned out Daniel's mother had taken seriously ill and Daniel was desperately searching for someone to take over his practice so that he could return home the the United States to be with her.  A few months later, September of 2004, Dr. Steven Harlow was the new proprietor of Quiropractica Vital and any remaining thoughts of retirement were soon forgotten.
